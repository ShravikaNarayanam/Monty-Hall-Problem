# Monty-Hall-problem: solution implemented using Python

The Monty Hall problem is a brain teaser, in the form of a probability puzzle, based on the American television game show Let's Make a Deal and named after its original host, Monty Hall. The problem was originally posed (and solved) in a letter by Steve Selvin to the American Statistician in 1975.

Problem Statement: You are a contestant on the show.Monty shows you three closed doors #1, #2, and #3.
Behind one door is a new car, but behind each of the other doors is a goat. You pick one of the doors.
Before Monty opens the door that you picked, he opens one of the other two doors and reveals a goat.
He gives you the option to switch to the third door.
You want to win that car! Should you stay with your original pick, or should you switch?

Solution: This conditional probability probelm is solved using python code and it shows sequence for each simulation whether you win the car by staying with your original door or by switching to the other unopened door.
